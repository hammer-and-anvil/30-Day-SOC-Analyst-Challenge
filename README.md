### Overview:
The **MyDFIR 30-day SOC Analyst Challenge** provided an intensive, hands-on experience simulating the daily tasks of a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst. Over 30 days, I was tasked with investigating security incidents, analyzing logs, detecting and mitigating threats, and responding to incidents. The challenge provided deep exposure to key SOC operations such as security monitoring, forensic investigation, and threat detection using a variety of cybersecurity tools and platforms.

### Key Learnings:
1. **Log Analysis with Elastic Stack**  
   Learned to stand up and efficiently use Elastic Stack (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana) to collect, search, and analyze large datasets of security logs from various network sources, identifying anomalies and potential threats.
   
2. **Advanced Threat Detection with Sysmon**  
   Configured Sysmon to gather detailed system activity logs and monitored for suspicious behavior, such as unusual process creation or network connections. 

3. **Red Teaming with Mythic**  
   Developed skills in offensive cybersecurity techniques using Mythic, a C2 (Command and Control) framework, to simulate attacks and assess vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

4. **Incident Response with osTicket**  
   Gained experience using osTicket to manage and track incident reports, ensuring efficient communication, resolution, and documentation of security incidents.

5. **Cloud Infrastructure Management with Vultr**  
   Utilized Vultr for deploying and managing virtual machines to simulate attack and defense scenarios, gaining hands-on experience with cloud security practices.

- **Days 14-17: Alerts and Dashboards in Kibana**  
  Define rules that detect conditions in your data and trigger actions when those conditions are met and create dashboard to visuallize where these attacks are sourcing from.

- **Journal**  
  These are the original notes taken during the project. While spelling errors have been corrected, other inaccuracies, including procedural mistakes, have been retained along with their corresponding corrections. All VMs have since been destroyed and some security information has been removed or obfuscated.

  > *(Note: Before uploading the journal, I intentionally left the API keys intact, as I was confident that the Virtual Machines (VMs) associated with them had been destroyed. In fact, all services in Vultr were wiped clean. However, I received an email notification from GitHub stating, "GitGuardian has detected the following X-API-Key secret exposed within your GitHub account." I appreciate GitHub's strong security measures and proactive approach to protecting the community. As a result, I have now removed the exposed API keys as a security best practice. Lesson learnedâ€”thank you, GitHub!)*

### Technologies/Tools Covered:
- **Elastic Stack (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana)**: Utilized for log aggregation, search, and visualization to identify security threats and suspicious activities across systems.
- **Sysmon**: Monitored system activity in real time, providing detailed logs for detecting advanced persistent threats (APTs) and suspicious processes.
- **Mythic**: Used for simulating real-world attacks, helping to understand offensive cybersecurity techniques and test defense mechanisms within a controlled environment.
- **osTicket**: Used for incident management, tracking and documenting security incidents from detection to resolution in a structured manner.
